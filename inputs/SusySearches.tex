\chapter{CMS Searches for Supersymmetry at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV}
\label{chap:susysearches}
One of the findings of Chapter~\ref{chap:run1pmssm}, and seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Z}, is that searches for SUSY events with purely hadronic final states have a particularly significant impact on our knowledge of the MSSM at CMS. Viewing the opportunity to develop techniques for hadronic searches as potentially fruit-bearing, I   decided to work on methods that increase the sensitivity of hadronic searches, including methods of QCD background estimation as well as Z$\rightarrow\nu\bar{\nu}$ background estimation, and techniques that maximize the usefulness of triggers used in hadronic analyses. These methods have been employed in the context of two high-$\met$ hadronic searches: the multi-jet + $\mht$ search~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdk} and the search for SUSY with top squarks~\cite{CMS:2016nhb}, the final results of which are discussed in Section \ref{sec:2015results}. Because many high cross section MSSM model points  survived Run 1 searches and are characterized by final states with low-$\met$ region (Chapter \ref{chap:run1pmssm}), I have focused on special techniques that allow these methods to work in the low-$\met$ regime. I have also explored the use of multivariate techniques in background-dominated kinematic regions like the low-$\met$ region, as well as the low-$\Ht$ region.

\section{Results of 2015 SUSY searches}
\label{sec:2015results}
The QCD background estimation, $\zinv$ background estimation, and trigger techniques just described were carried out in the context of two CMS SUSY searches. This section briefly describes these analyses, their baseline selection and search region definitions, the primary backgrounds, and an interpretation of their findings in terms of various simplified model spectra (SMSs). I note that the following results are the product of the work of dozens of analysis team members, and the work I have described above constitutes a few ingredients of the following collaborative effort. The searches are based on a sample of proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV~$ with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2015, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb$^{-1}$.
