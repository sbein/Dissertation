\chapter{Other discriminating variables}
\label{app:discriminators}
Many special variables have been designed to exploit different aspects of the nature of SUSY signals, and we have described, and CMS has performed  a large number of analyses in which all these variables are used. We point out that these variables are highly correlated with each other as well as highly correlated with the MET, and it is thus not immediately clear how much value each contributes to our ability to constrain full spectrum SUSY models. It is expected that a special variable taken on its own likely adds a great deal of signal/background discrimination power, but as the variables are combined, the added discrimination power diminishes. The framework for the pMSSM interpretation and the analysis targeting the non-excluded regions provides an excellent framework in which to test the effectiveness of these variables individually as well as relative to one another.
