\section{Conclusions}

The results of a search for direct pair production of supersymmetric scalar top quarks in the all-hadronic final state has been performed.  
%
The top squarks may decay directly to stable neutralinos and top quarks, or may decay to charginos (nearly degenerate with the neutralinos) and bottom quarks.  
%
Top squark decay branching fractions to a top quark and neutralino of 100\% and 50\% have been studied.  
%
The data sample analyzed corresponds to 2.3~\fbinv of proton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV by the CMS detector at the CERN LHC.  

No significant deviations beyond the Standard Model are observed and exclusion limits at 95\% confidence are set.  
%
In the case where both top squarks decay to top quarks and neutralinos, the median expected lower limit on the top squark mass reaches 800~\GeV, for small neutralino masses, and the observed limit excludes top squark masses below about 770~\GeV at 95\% confidence level.  
%
For large neutralino masses in the same model, the median expected lower mass limit on the neutralino reaches about 280~\GeV with an observed limit near 240~\GeV, for a top squark mass near 650~\GeV. 
%
In the case which includes a light chargino (nearly degenerate with the neutralino), allowing the top squark to decay to a bottom quark and chargino with 50\% probability, the median expected lower limit reaches 700~\GeV, for a neutralino mass near 100~\GeV, and the observed limit excludes top squark masses below about 670~\GeV at 95\% confidence level. 
%
For larger neutralino masses, the median expected lower limit on the neutralino mass reaches about 240~\GeV with an observed limit near 200~\GeV.
